# average_of_polls
Average of Polls pulled from RCP but displayed with error


Eventual goal: used mixed-effects to correct for "House Effect" on polling error.


Note that excel doc is structured to be copy/pasted into a jupyter notebook, not actually used for analysis directly becuase no IDE is available on a work computer.
